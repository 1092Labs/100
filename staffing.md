# As with any endeavor, critical & specialized roles will need to be played for an effective and fruitful shot on goal, continuously.

## Historian
An oracle that commits to the repo the complete, sound, & undeniably critical truths of the world as it pertains to the directives in pursuit, the resources & commitments in tandem, and comedic relief to lighten the pressure.

1. Immutable records of forecasts casted, promises/commitments/intentions linearly mapped with consistent gradient scoring, and the ware bouts of the community that is consulted, consoled in, and continuously critiques.
2. Succinct, unambiguous, and weighted against comprehension & cohesion against the user stories, experiments, & end customer feedback.
3. Not a single date missed. Only way to lose. Even an invisible unicode counts as a successful day because showing up is just about 80% of the fight. 20% is figuring out whether it's the Market St in Oakland or in San Francisco. :)

Like Daniel Pinkman says, to sell is human. Sales is about moving people and we need to move people to show up, expand thee realm of possibilities (Edward Bono), and to take a leap of faith on the better version of us that serves the collective, facilitates the magic of maker culture, and invites others to dream with us, lucid.

1. Actively promoting the interests, insights, & humane-centric dialogue that will extend our reach using content marketing, natively extract heuristics that can be public artifacts for learning, and serve as a direct line of communication with future customers, advocates, & well sampled inputs that's always-on.
2. Facilitating 1:1 and 1:12 design sprints with target customers, industry experts, & user and product-market-fit testing.
3. Sending weekly newsletters to public stakeholders; bi-weekly performance evaluations; and occasional marketing material needed to bring a prototype to life.
