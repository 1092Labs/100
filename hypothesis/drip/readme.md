# The juice is worth the squeeze

Fish of the year for me is goldfish so you better know this hypothesis came to smile at ya! This morning, I actually gave up on my little tube of toothpaste and then also had to squeeze out all the moisture out of the lotion bottle. I mean, I am not saying it was hard but you know it's been a highlight for 2021. I imagine your favorite bottle of whatever(TM) is why you were late this morning. Well, let's "measure what matters" like Mr. Doer suggests.

# Welcome to the world of fluid dynamics
First of all:  The fact that I'm writing about this on Github is clear evidence of my qualifications. Now, let's talk about flow, shearing, and why the smooth and thicc retraction of the liquid inside is the work of science. Oooooo. Literally.

## Why does a manufacturer measure this value?
1. To make sure you don't dirty up your fingers or the counter if you put it back - cap or not. The ability for the liquid to be able to return to its "default" or its "rest" state allows for syrup and whip cream companies to create sounds, texture showtime, and physics really feel...satisfying.

2. It can serve as a proxy measure for quality in both the actual product being produced and the distributed or batched manufacturing that's checked before it leaves.

3. It can be the difference between the bathroom sink remaining in stationary position or getting flipped. Yeah, I'm sure you have that product you're going to make sure you really get your money, time, and loyalty worth. Specifically, it can influence how much you use at once. Most important: it is the boss mode level in the game of life that ends in the trash can or a wrestling match with material science.

## So what?
Well, you have to first respect why this opportunity is dead-obvious but only possible to actualize if you consider what it can mean for a few things:
1. ANY level of yield in raw material savings in consumption, packaging, & use:throw ratio means a great deal for not just the market efficiency but the feel-good icing that comes without pushing change down someone's already air-tight process, labor/market responsibility, and the desire to not change the entire end-to-end process that took a while.

Oh, nature and the future would be thankful because we can not only waste natural resources but we can ensure that the savings actually open doors for other industries to now consider a fixed cost now possibly....dripping.

2. It's part of your day and you can start it off with a title won against the last bit of whatever. Also, you'd be using it for longer or throw it away less often. While not a goal, maybe someone can use the cost savings to do R&D on the actual plastics.

3. This could totally be a cool way for students and researchers to flex some greed and selfishness for a good cause. If you can align these incentives, you could reward early adopters by having the consumers reward that with standards or legislative bodies creating incentives for trial...the rest you hope market efficiency can solve things. If it was my bottle, I only want to hear your opinion if it can make the value cycle spin.

It's crucial that you not see this as an idea or an entity. It's an opportunity for you to launch a career in a bold way if you can understand the marketing value & the bragging rights to flex on an initiative that can be entirely funded by the collective direction of kids who want to work hard to learn the hard stuff to make this happen. There needs to exist some secret that will allow us to all win if we can bring together the consumers, producers, and short squeeze market liquidity that keeps the whole thing rational. The only failure is to assume it's in anyone's hand but yours.

That's just about all I know so I'll just dip out...for now
