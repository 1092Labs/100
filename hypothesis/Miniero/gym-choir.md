# This is not normal. It's okay. Make the most of it.

So, a recent discussion led to a revelation about the world: gym class and singing are still happening; Zoom or Zootopia style. So here's the first thing that came to my head:

1) Gym on Zoom: Xbox Kinect that was advanced for its time at being able to just map the joints and leg/arm movements so that game developers could use them as input signals. Revolutionary. Really, dance! I'd be the kid that woudl be willing to learn CV just to be able to say you can't make me. But again, kinda the attitude you need to have to be able to actually advance this problem into a scalable solution for those poor souls having to look at a grid of jumping jacks and not be able to blow the whistle at me.. xD
2) Singing on Zoom: I'd instantly be kicked out from the band or choir if I was in it. I was kind of hoping to just let that one kid do his or her thing and lay back. Next thing you know, latency and ping spikes got me and the whole class listening to my screech happen 3 seconds ahead.

So...both of these sound like a nightmare to my young self so I figured this would be a good place to find some comedic relief and inspiration. This time, concurrency is really a requirement for live experierences to feel like a orchaestra.

If this hypothesis turns into a meaningful solution: I expect students to perform "we are the world" in synchrony and in perfect tandem. Which just made me realize: what if you never actually improved the technology at all? What if you just took from Chrome's book and used the perception of speed. What if you orchastrated the stream so that you delay and stream to eliminate variance.
I guess you can say that it was one short hop for networking and a ping pong for humanity. Love.

Thanks WOHS: You really really really love your sports and atheletics. Figures....we're champions baby!!!! Man it feels good to not be a kid these days. You have no idea how excited I am for you to thrive in this new economy; novel social transition into equitable mediums; and the glory that is being able to say "AFK" in class. Seroiusly, for all the struggles and hardship you face, I know you'll shape the future into something that we will be so jelous of. I'll be cheering you on and supporting you with comedic relief and some inspiration. God speed!
