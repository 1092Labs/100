# This hypothesis is dedicated to an unsung hero Lorenzo Miniero

He has pretty much drew up the blueprint to saving the entire music industry, experience, & collaborative spirit with his presentation "Can WebRTC help musicians?" In creating this presentation, he ended up reaching an entrepreneur with enough interest in the WebRTC protocol, desire to help music and musicians thrive, and the respect to take from open source and passionate dreamers in hopes of honestly & transparently connecting the dots to help make them into reality with go-to-market approaches with a hacker spirit & the tenacity of a corporate lawyer determined to make SoundCloud & Spotify the companies that succeed at being the front-end to these innovations powered by open server & protocol ecosytems. I need hype music to do my meaningful work and it'd be nice if the Dons of the game can open doors for the newcomers seeing that we're supporting all creatives to grow the pie / market as to fulfill the mission of "making the world dance"

# Roadmap

1. Get acquainted with WebRTC protocol to understand how to host the token / handshake steps for managing few:many broadcasts
2. Review OSS efforts like JamRTC with Janus
3. Define a point of view on how to cultivate mechanism design research on routing protocols and hardware/network innovations to lower latency between the browser, drivers, hardware, and everything in between.
4. Review OSS projects like JACK Audio Connection Kit that allows MIDI & other hardware support for clients & browsers
5. Create open source linux server, client, & even data store implementations that can allow the community to help tweak and improve up and down the stack to get latency to near 0
6. Finally, let's create a market that will incentivize both the record labels, the copyright & licensing enforcers, & the platforms that have the distribution already to work cooperatively to grow the market with the principles of:
   A) Empowering creators with more autonomy over the creativity, deal-making, & who else is empowered by every dollar that they make
   B) Ensure that platforms don't corner artists against the people and platforms that made them who they are that needs to harmoniously coexist
   C) Invent new freedoms & opportunities for up-and-coming artists to participate in the value generation that algorithm & curator generated playlists & radios will offer a mic to. Ensure that they're made by, for, & with the people they serve.
