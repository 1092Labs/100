# Social wallet recovery for Ethereum Wallets

This is a pretty though problem that needs to be solved for us to be able to have adoption without fear and anxiety every time you handle a wallet.

### What do we know so far?
1. Well, there are lots of great onramps to Web3 including MetaMask, Toshi, & MyEtherWallet. While I feel bad for jumping to a solution, it's pretty clear that social graphs are the best recovery mechanism but making sure the UX and affordances built into the product design must be second to none.
2. Between the fattest DApp, protocol, and wallet, I think it's fair to say that winning the wallet has huge payoffs. So, in spirit of not having to be the guardian for go-to-market on these problem spaces, it means more to me that we be greedy and make sure the human support for this tool is at least...there. Which means attempting to fuel an entire market of human support staff being self-funded by the profits this tool makes. Yes, it'll make profit and reinvest it. So since there is a lot of value in both the data, auth, & the future browser with a wallet, it probably makes the most sense for anyone to compete to provide the best resolutions. This has to be broken down into quality metrics.
3. As for the wallet itself, it's likely that people have been burned and are jaded by sharing contact book so that component has to be done in as safe, intentional, & community audited way possible. The fact that this requires managing multi-signature wallet configurations likely means there is a choice between building on existing custodians like BitGo or build open source implementations. For the sake of consistency and convenience, I would challenge the community to go ham on cross-platform mobile dev if it doesn't come at the cost of libraries that you need to make it as safe as possible.

## What this IS; and assume all else is irrelevant for now
1. End-to-end flow for mobile wallet design that aims to crate the best affordances & friendly onramp for the community
2. Attempts at trying to do a survey of existing research, OSS, and tutorials that can help me stitch together an architecture that tries to find as many weak points and invite critique.


## Expectations
1. Given this is mostly reading and Sketch/Framer, I will contribute here as a means of allowing a lot of iterations with a high but not excellent bar for quality for at least the first 3-5 iterations. This also means I  have to figure out how to not bloat this git with Sketch files haha. It'll be great! Any dent here is good.


# Secret sauce
1. Gamify the process so that you are spending more time in simulation than in actual moving of bits. My friends and I really believe in this as a proper onramp to crypto.
2. Rely on auctions to actively fight collusion & front-running by ensuring the integrity, robustness, & resilience way before recovery comes around. Imagine the front end being more of a simple yes/no/swipe mechanic to reward users for securing their friends and however far they're willing to extend
3. Thinking about bridges into the real world. There exist tons of laws today for custodians & bailor/bailee that allow you to trust other entities with things with some built-in guarantees. At least for now, I'm not sure if you can code that into a smart contract but there are a lot of 3rd party oracle data from both clients & intra-network interactions that people should be able to safely offer for added reassurance.
4. Security is not optional. However, talented researchers, auditors, & even their testing suite isn't as rigorous as having an entity that's able to take the liability & a registered custodian. That being said, I'm being cautious & careful about rollout, adoption, & local laws (esp you NY fam! Bitlicense is no joke). If this project just becomes a UX improvement, that's successes too.


Please note that there will likely be more official channels to try out anything here. For now, assume everything is experimental and likely to break until you see us put our name on it and say it's stable.
