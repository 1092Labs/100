# Succinct

Lots of innovations in glorified recurssion - just kidding - have found themselves into Zero Knowledge Proofs and also their applications in creating succint blockchains (see Coda) and the possibilities are endless. How might we explore these to make information digestion and information deep-linking more useful so that we consume the content that can deliver the highest fidelity of understanding. The goal is purefuly for social conversations not informative content. 


## Throwback

I had this idea in high school to digitize the bulletin board because I couldn't hear over the kids yapping when the PA system would announce the clubs and activities.

1. Subscribtion feed for all your clubs. All the juicy details for next practice and meet-up. FB groups today pretty much.
2. Public feed with 1 post from each club a week. 30 seconds and you're cought up. Digest that is voted up by the group and moderated by heads of clubs.
3. Media or content based categories that are crowdsourced and intra-club curated. This was similar to what TagMe tried to achieve. Similarly, we created topics for dating app content creation incentives on Lively (Zoosk dating app I worked on at one point)
