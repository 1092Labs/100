# What is each item's inverse proxy measure, property, or identity?

1. What is the absense of information conveying?
2. What can you set before and after the item to see if it is colluding its information? Similar to red zones in memory sanitization
3. What can you say about when it shouldn't be there? What can you say is almost always true unless....

# What can you do to move the item 1 point from 1-10 towards familiarity?


# What can you reframe to identify the emotional context around the item? Would the weather, volume, or texture change anything?
