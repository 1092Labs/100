# How to turn information into intelligence using concept mapping, improvements proposed, and rudimentary concepts in data structures / “data flow”


## Atomic data representation

### What is a node? How might renaming it change our understanding?

#### Taking queue from SYNC — a book on order amidst chaos
Let's consider how an “Oscillator” might evolve our definition of a leaf or a node. What makes this Oscillator be deserving of its name?
It can have cascading effects to neighboring information that can
1) SYNC applications
   - Heart
     -
   - Fireflies
     -

4) Red Zones (Memory sanitization)
Keeping a fence for the amount of Oscillators you can have in a Series

5) Osmos (game)
Eat up Oscillators around as to enlarge itself
  - Property changes
  - Aggregation
  - Clustering / Grouping
  -[INVITED_TO_EXPAND]

6) [Add novel analogies to expand and evolve]

### What could a node represent on the map?
One set of possibilities are mappings of a concept with key:value dictionary mapping to enable inherited, decaying, evolving, & eventually immutable attributes that allow it to become more than just a premise or an idea.
