# Bricolage

#### This topic is dedicated, in gratitude of, and in spirit of falling in love

I should first start by admitting that I have a hard time spelling this word without gooling it. Because I have Google though, I use it as a spell check sometimes; which - comically - is the essence of the bricolage anyway. Making something of the things around you.

3. Try something

This is hard and I admit it too. The silver lining is that you can never create the conversation on your own to output the lesson or mindset you come out of from a chit-chat.
So, how does this not get awkward or feel scripted?!?! Maybe it's the tools.

"Interested is interesting" as I learned recently. Means: be comfortable knowing you're authentic if you really wanna hear the answers from a question. Wise advice I got is that it's rude to ask just to ask. So let's bake this in.

Sounds like a routing, matching, or voting problem? What? You think it's too much economics buzz? For me too; but the core concepts are what get you the confidence to ask deeper questions. Most papers are for those being measured on post-99.99% gains. Like self driving car stuff - not some wannabe LinkedIn...haha
But seriously: how you come into a conversation matters. Topic, person, industry, or even an intro...

This can be pulled together from RSS feeds from blogs and have the top 25 HN of the week be the conversation piece. Generally, casual interactions here are for the "ah, you're also into that too?"
People write and blog. Finding and keeping up is only this weeks hot topic. Ya dig?
