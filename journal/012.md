Today is a new day; an opportunity; a chance to be present. Here I am: showing up. Showing up to maximize the social welfare function is great but being selfish for it is even better. I would like to stroke my own ego but today I think it's worth admitting that getting my thoughts down would actually free me up to create bandwidth for technical deep-dives. It's so hard to feel like you can rabit-hole into one thing without putting to rest what's in buffer right now. Today, I'd like to dive deeper into the actual math behind all of this. Attempt to define the game and then maybe even link a few papers for inspiration. Lots of social problems are matching, routing, voting, or governance problems in disguise. Let me figure out what researchers and academia folks have done already in the spaces I care about before I go to deep into my own assertions.
