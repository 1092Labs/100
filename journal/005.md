## Start
1. Just even a line of code will do. Literally: anything. When you have founder-code-itus you just gotta jump belly first. Daaaaangeer zone.

## stop
1. Giving into the pressure that is temporal but is there to serve a purpose as a signal. Stay on target as they say. So today, I'm going to have a book open nearby in case i get a case of the "bruh, really?"


## continue
1. The continuous game. Stay in the game. Streak. I mean, continue the streak. It's no joke, ask Sienfeld.

## target
1. Focus on enumerating the appropriate scope for building something with the core concepts needed to learning

## log
1. Dipping my toes into state machines (I guess you can say keeping the water just-right is a state machine too...*faint laughter*)
