# Carry over
1. What do I expect to do to start Day 009, with target drived input, to simply enumerate the 4th and 5th degree effect of each hypothesis (3 is okay).?

- If I assumed that Day 009 me was 1/10 the person that Day 090 would be, as is in time, what could I imagine I am not able to understand how to define or measure
- If I assume the 4th and 5th degree effect are likely inverse effects of the prior 2, what could I anticipate could undo the change I'm trying to make
- Do I even have the verbiage or the dictionary to enumerate or define what that would feel like? New experiences and world states could actually be contradictions of the world I know so well
- Before bed time and after, the relevant takeaway for this project is that the time it takes to return to a default or rest state is the long term measure that matters because there's likely a lot of previous change  I have yet to register
- Finally, I think it would suffice to simply just hold off on shipping anything else for today (as suggested by book "Managing your day-to-day)

*** Once progress begins, it has the terrible effect of making you feel like all your process is progressing too. Yikes. If I've gone around the startup rodeo a few times, there's probably a good reason why I feel this much intention is important early in the creative process.
