Today is a new day; an opportunity; a present to be shared with someone scared, excited, & anxious but vulnerable enough to pair-facilate this Portal level with me. Otherwise, I feel like I'm jumping in and out of portals in perpetuity. Don't worry, Day 100 has a bigger pie waiting for us so don't be that guy from Office Space. The fork is the truth.

Make it a good day! Look forward to sharing some inspiration for Day 99 with you so you don't dare celebrate a day too early!

I have done circles around the hype game and I'm opening with my best so you can headline the show! I've tried to share my heart, soulful faith, and second to none young-stunner-by-the-dozen attitude. Why? Never mind.......I still think I'm cute! DREAM.md avaliable for your lows and highs...now back to the dialogue - DRAM said it's just a part of the come up. If Github had gifs, I would put the one with the stack of cash as a phone...Hello? Yes, I can hear you now....on this spectrum auction I just won!!! Just like we drew it up! Let's talk about voting schemes and auctions (avoiding ads, marketplaces, & network effects out of respect for my teachers)
