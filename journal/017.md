Today is a new day; an opportunity; a present to be shared with someone scared, excited, & anxious but vulnerable enough to pair-facilate this Portal level with me. Otherwise, I feel like I'm jumping in and out of portals in perpetuity. Don't worry, Day 100 has a bigger pie waiting for us so don't be that guy from Office Space. The fork is the truth.

Make it a good day! Look forward to sharing some inspiration for Day 99 with you so you don't dare celebrate a day too early!
