Today is a new day; an opportunity; and a day for me to take some rest and figure out where my heart is. I'd like to have my right hand to the plough and not look back. It's really stressful for me to think about dreaming more cautiously so I don't cause more mess while trying to do good. If it works, I won't really know. 

I would like to get my own thoughts on "paper" before I dive into other research so here's a laundry list of things on my mind. Some of them are useful for near term. Others are just here to publically document where I'm sampling from. Though right now my main focus is on learning CSV from the ground up. I'm hoping it finally lets me get the PM stamp of approval. I made it y'all!!!! Spreadsheets galoreee!
