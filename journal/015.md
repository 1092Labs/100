Reading an article that inspired the current frontier of computing we're at from software to hardware. 
So far, it seems my hypothesis that we don't make use of what we already have and don't make more of the research already done is on the right track.
Welp, seems like we've come 75 years only to start from the same spot. Wild. Half way done with article as of this morning.

### IRL
Currently IRL is kicking my butt. Figuring out a way to not have this be derailed.
Also will begin to write more journal for the week to come privately, and will share later with 80% min transfer. Maybe my emotions are getting in the way. Who knows.
