Working on getting my life together. This has oddly been a priority lately. Who knows, maybe it'll be a trend.

On another note, folks at MindNode shared an awesome project that's got me excited:  https://docs.learn-anything.xyz/roadmap
So I'll be spending some time digging into that this week and weekend

I've also got some mind map ideas I'd like to create a public invite for collaboration on. Keep an eye out for that in a new hypothesis this week.
