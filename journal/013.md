What version of the past are we leaving in the past? Counter factual thinking is really harmful to eradicating inertia. Generally, the conclusion so far is that there are a lot of researchers, change catalysts, and leaders who can also elicit cheerleaders. So if there are a lot of folks who care, then the way to bring their sweat and tears into today's and tomorrow's transition is by making sure that I can systemically do so by breaking up the research. Then it's like an Amazon inspired, and what we rolled out at Twitter as well, "silent" digestion of marketing copy created from the research. We take FAQ and 1-Pagers to another level. If you can write a screenplay for the prime time animation feature for an ad. (Ahem: Slack, Grubhub, and Charmin).

### Well, starting today...I've gotten good at being greedy and selfish for this initiative. It takes that for it to be something. Onward...
