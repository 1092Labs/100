## Measuring what matters
In order for us to be able to control the levers that yield the highest feedback signal in a feedback loop, it would make sense to keep track of the leading indicator as variables, hypothesis, and well triaged and tracked forecasting evaluations.

In order to adequately learn, create, & analyze, we need to ensure that there is a kanban style lifecycle tracking for questions that recursively filter, focus, & surface the most meaningful experiments that can prove or disprove the line of reasoning or logic.

As per the Effective Executive, we aim to be effective; efficiency, substance, & excellence are non-goals. On this note, it would be silly if we assumed that time didn't matter *at all*. As such, we aim to define segments on deep work (1 1/2 hours for me) and Pomodoro (12 minutes for me) timers so we can systemically curb inertia & regenerate the momentum by just doing 1....(ha!)
