##  It would be nice if tomorrow could....
Storyboarding possible viable remixes between the different focus areas, skills, & the temporal trends that can bootstramp the GTM of.

## Action I plan on taking tomorrow to get myself unstuck from whatever is in parking lot, idea marinate sauce, & stove burner to be a conversation piece for dialogue debuggging...
Lay out enough structure to make it easy to dump what's top of mind (brain not on EC upgrade yet haha). That way, I can wonder around without feeling like I have thoughts bog  me down.

## What is the ONE thing that I can do that will make the tomorrow me have an easier time to start, stop, or continue...
Start the day by reading material that will simmer & marinate for the rest of the day. Pro tip: the best teachers are your teacher's teachers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_NxQNmGgco (I hope this video brings you as much joy as it has for me. I'm just passing it on. Rewind pls.)

## How close are we to creating 3 orders of magnitude change in GDP for SMBs, market efficiency for tacit knowledge indexing, & social contracts evoked with high trust:collateral marketbook with depth, liquidity, & hopium filled optimism about wisdom of the crowd.
