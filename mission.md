# Mission Statement 
- I want to spend the next 10 years building communities and products that cultivate empathy. 

## Part 1: Connecting 
- Build tools that act as catalysts for connecting people and their ideas.

## Part 2: Collaboration
- Humans are inherently selfless so let's build a product that embraces that. 

## Part 3: Diversity
- Wisdom of the crowd can only be achieved when ideas derive from unique perspectives. 
- Social echo chambers don't lead to social progression. How can we expose people to multiple opinions so they can make informative decisions?
- Diversity in organizations can lead to change if there exists diversity in the decision making team. 
Organization structures need to place an emphasis on diversity in the decision makers. 

## Part 4: Decentralization
- Communities need to be self-sustaining and self-sufficient. 
- As we connect more people to the internet, there will be more information flowing can be digested. A platform must exist to aggregate private judgments and turn them into collective decisions.
- We need to stop treating communities as if they were separate entities. There are communities with similar goals & interests, let's create a bridge for deeper collaboration and communication. 
- Fragmentation in information distribution system are detrimental to innovation. Google, ProductHunt, Reddit, and Twitter utilize a hybrid of user and machine curation to surface relevant content. Machines create bias because they rely on data that humans preset. Can we build scalable platforms to only rely humans for information distribution and curation?
