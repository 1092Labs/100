# Open offer
This field is still ripe for a lot of fresh ideas so I welcome you to participate. If I feel like you could provide a lot of value but have a lot of life stuff going on, you are already welcome into our support system. One day I'd like to do 1:1 but right now, I will do you better if you can help me solve it for others too with tooling & dialogue that can make....doing this - and whatever you're upto - more enjoyable.
Right now, if you make an issue for a work-life balance or social-learning idea/challenge that you have, I'm willing to spend the time to make sure I give a very thoughtful response on how we might be able to free up some energy, bandwidth, & tension so you can get back to your thing; even if it's not our thing. https://github.com/AbenezerMamo/Canvas
This project is going to be around for a 100 days so even as it grows, you can beat the spider.txt and just DM me if you need anything: including mediocure tech support, critique on your projects, or just a better question in response to yours. GG no RE. Now, that's an intent so know that if i fail to hold up on it, it's likely only because I need support to and need some love. I am willing to ask for help and so should you. Maybe what you need is inspiration from a link, video, or idk; whatever.



# Vision
When the 100 days are over, maybe we can do a let's play or something.
