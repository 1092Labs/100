# This a place to track the personal development I need to do to step-up to what this initiative needs
Order doesn't imply importance. Not collectively exhaustive.

## Engineering
1. Pub-sub best practices so the CRON jobs / webhooks / data-pipelines I am going to create can adhere to some quality standards
2. CLI workflow improvements to more easily manage the increasing depth in the mutually exclusive hypothesis and its respective information, analysis, & reports
3. Google Functions or AWS Lambda so I don't have to have a lot of overhead or technical-founder-debt that also ensures that my tooling choices don't constrain the autonomy and productivity of others on the Team
4. Regex, just enough to get by, so I can curb analysis-debt that accrues from the exponential time required to actually open these tabs or digest any of the gold in them. Just simple ways to ensure that others can also define "rules" to tailor the filtering or parsing to be actionable, worthwhile, & question-indexed
