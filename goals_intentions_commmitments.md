# How do I not trip over my own feet?
A very very very, very, lightning talk on my discovery of the study of control systems; mechanism design (auction, voting, protocols, network effects); and the desire to make some use of these super computers in our pocket without letting my Wiki/HN dives, tooling-treasure-hunt, & all the clicks in between to systemically expose my not-FLEEK side, antipatterns, unintended behavior, and consequential intentions to just be at the latest edge on DND, runonns and spell-check-, and the likeihood that I get cought in my own b.s...

Okay, this is going to be a lot less of me trying to pretend like my grammar or poetry have cought up to my ability to put together a prototype with code & research-evidence that I promise will get better.


# NON-GOALS
1. Essay
2. Notebook or journal
3. Anything that's not code. It's hard. So where I can, I'll include videos, blogs, & forum links that can catch me before I try to flex on a field that can run circles around me. Funny thing is, they just got Crysis 3 running and didn't even break a sweat. Just kidding: but do expect GTA V, Dota / Starcraft, & skill-based games to be my opportunity to make sure I can tell myself I'm on topic. They're actually highly relevant.
