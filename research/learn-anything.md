In preservation of my own points of view I have yet to write down, I will try to make space to get my thoughts into a commit before I dig deeper. Otherwise, I'll never know if other future collaboration prospects have choosen a unique path out of randomnesss, intention, being naieve, being first, being right, or even just caring too much. You have to assume that if you want to apropriately learn from your peers, you have to seperate your own beliefs from that you embody without intention and out-right steal credit. So excited to know of its existance and so hyped to figure out what they learned but let's make sure we make space for our novel and unique prespectives too. That way, I can quote the mic-drops and quick-wit my way around friendly competition. The winner is a better version of us.
